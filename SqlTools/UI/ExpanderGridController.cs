    /// Often, Expander controls are placed into layout grids and specific ColumnDefinition or RowDefinition objects should be essentially
    /// expanded and collapsed along with the associated Expander. This must be done by setting the Width (ColumnDefinition) or Height
    /// (RowDefinition) to GridLength.Auto when the Expander is Collapsed, then resetting it to the pre-collapsed value when Expanded. This
    /// behavior uses the x:Name attribute of the Expander to locate the associated ColumnDefinition or RowDefinition.
